				About the Legend
			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Maharana Pratap (c. 9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), was a king of Mewar from the Sisodia dynasty. Pratap became a folk hero for his military resistance against the expansionism of the Mughal 
				Empire under Akbar through guerrilla warfare which proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals including Shivaji..<br><br>
				☛ Maharana Pratap is revered as one of the strongest warriors India has ever seen.
				 Standing at 7 feet 5 inches, he would carry a 80-kilogram spear and two swords weighing around 
				 208 kilograms in total. He would also wear an armour weighing 72 kilograms<br><br>
				☛ Before fighting the Mughals, Pratap had to face the wrath of his domestic adversaries. By the time of his reign, almost all Rajput dynasties had surrendered to Akbar and had become members of his council. 
				Akbar had sent six diplomatic missions to Pratap to create a peaceful alliance between the two mighty rulers<br><br>
				☛ Pratap had rebuilt his capital in the city of Chavand, around 60 kilometres south of Udaipur and spent the rest of his life there.
				 Because of his fight for freedom against the Mughals, Maharana Pratap is widely regarded as India's first native freedom fighter.
